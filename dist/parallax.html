        <p>Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? They were just sucked into space. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me</p>
